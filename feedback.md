Great job on the delivery! The project shows a solid understanding of the core concepts, and the frontend is visually appealing and well-structured. I was especially pleased to see that you followed the architectural patterns taught — congratulations on that!

**Frontend**

- The JavaScript code is clean and well-written. I particularly liked the use of the fallback to the homepage in `router.js` — a smart and practical solution.

- In `footer.js` and the view components, consider breaking the code into smaller functions to improve readability and maintainability.

- Using `innerHTML` to inject HTML content can introduce potential bugs and doesn't scale well. It's better to use templating or DOM manipulation methods.

- It seems there are two files named `health-view.js` — be mindful of naming to avoid confusion.

- Some functions have very large bodies; aim to encapsulate logic into smaller units for clarity.

- Don't forget to always use curly brace in if statements, even for single-line conditions — it enhances readability and helps prevent subtle bugs.

- Clean up your CSS by removing unused or unnecessary code to keep it maintainable.

- Watch file naming conventions, especially in CSS. Stick to consistent and clear naming patterns.

- Remove the `.idea` folder from your repository or add it to a `.gitignore` file to keep your repo clean.

Consider adding a `config.properties.example` file so that others can easily understand the expected structure and required variables of your configuration.

**Backend**

- Java package names should be in lowercase — this is the standard convention.

- Avoid catching generic exceptions. Instead, handle specific exceptions to make error handling clearer and more robust.

- Be careful with sending generic internal server errors; use more precise and meaningful HTTP status codes where appropriate.

- The `login()` method in your `LoginController.java` has a complex branching structure with multiple if-else statements — try simplifying or refactoring for better clarity.

- Avoid throwing runtime exceptions from controllers. It's better to handle the issue within the controller and return an appropriate response.

- Form validation is an area worth investing in — it can significantly improve user experience and protect your backend from invalid data.

- I encourage you to explore other technologies in the future, such as Spring Boot, React, Angular, or Quarkus — expanding your stack will be valuable.


**Final Words**

Overall, good work — the frontend is beautiful and the architecture is well-implemented. I'm proud of the progress you've made and the attention to best practices. Keep it up, and continue challenging yourselves!
